    !!! failure "Unbanned"
        None of the evidence provided held any ground when additional context was given, implying that this was just a case of false allegations with malicious intent.
        Which is a [Network Bannable Offense}(https://docs.starlightcommunity.network/hub/actions/network-bans/#:~:text=False%20Allegations%20With%20Malicious%20Intent%20(Starting/Aiding))



## Reason
The users has shown malicious behavior that would render our community vulnerable to illicit interations and retalation towards staff. 

## Evidence

!! info "Notice"

    Most of the Discord messages could not be proven to be real, as nobody could show the original messages or provide message IDs to prove the messages really exist and were not altered using an image editing tool or inspect element, so they have been removed to prevent harm.
