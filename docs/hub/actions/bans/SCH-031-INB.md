<h6>Banned on June 6, 2025</h6>

The users has been banned from Starlight Community Network for Trust and Safety. with that being said **DO NOT** harass anyone who has been punished. ^^***That's targeting may result in a 1-month ban or at most a Network Wide Ban.***^^

!!! note "Staff Notes"

    This its still being worked on as we are a staff member down RN due to personal issues to help prevent this [join us](https://www.starlightcommunity.network/positions)

## Reason

In a voice call, the user stated this “I had people sent her death threats to her bitch ass and made them delete their account” towards someone that they put on their “wall of shame” channel which is just a board made to encourage There discord server to Harassment of people they don’t like and while in a VC with the user who had blocked them they comment “I have beef with someone, and they're in this VC.” show no empathy or consideration with a sour and toxic attitude.

TLDR: Toxic Behavior, Staff Abusement, Harassment Campaigns/Glorifying Violence, Doxxing, Breaking of Discord TOS & Community Guidelines
