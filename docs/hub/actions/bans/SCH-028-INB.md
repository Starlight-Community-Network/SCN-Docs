!!! note "Staff Notes"

    This case has been sitting since October of 2024, and since it sat here and action was not taken due to the stress that this event causes to staff, this will be thrown out, cause its to late to do anything really.

## Reason
The user made a now deleted x post with the intent to [cancel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancel_culture) and cause drama twards an individual on a platform know for its Harassment Campaigns because them and the individual didn't see eye to eye.

!!! info "Context"

    Looking into this case recently, we quoted these screenshots, but the uncensored versions show that the person they were calling out seems to be living in a state where the AOC is 16. It doesn't change much from our perspective, but like the Twitter poster said, the law is the law, and we have to respect it even if we don't agree with it, so the person who was "called out" legally did nothing wrong.
