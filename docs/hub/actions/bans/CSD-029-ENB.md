# ID: CSD-029-ENB
<h6>Banned on Aug 15, 2024 | Updated on Aug 28, 2024</h6>

The user were been banned from Starlight Community Network for Trust and Safety, with that being said **DO NOT** harass anyone who has been punished. ^^***That's targeting may result in a 1-month ban or at most a Network Wide Ban.***^^

!!! info "Aug 20 Update"

    As of August 28, Drama broke out regarding involving one of our staff members. A group chat was made making bold allegations towards our staff member, mostly for the sole purpose of the didn't like signal, and this, that, and the 3rd, in that same group chat screenshots sent to the staff that proved the original screenshots to be fake. We are sorry for problems that we'd caused, but the topic wasn't one to play around with, so we had to do what's best for our community at the time I hope you accept our apology.

## Reason
The user was allegedly accused of doing something “bad (With Screenshots to back up the claim).” The user asked almost non-stop to have the OG post removed, which doesn't make this situation any better, while another user was verbally abusing a staff member who wasn't even involved in the ban process.

??? note "Staff Notes"

    I personally confronted the user that was punished, offering a chance to appeal, and they replied, “the 6 servers on there i want nothing to do with,” which, if you ask me, just shoots themselves in the foot because it's implying that it's true. You would think they would want to clear their name even if that was the case, but do your due diligence and research. There's always more than one side to the story. We are just playing it safe.

Let me get to the point: these are to act like public ban/warn records, so if you do get banned or warned, you're not left clueless or feel like you were shadow-banned or something along those lines. That's why at the top it says, “DO NOT harass anyone who has been punished or any of the staff.” this is not RoR Shaderoom. We. ^^***DON'T***^^. Tolerate. It.



## Evidence
This will be left empty, I'm going to give the user the benefit of the doubt
