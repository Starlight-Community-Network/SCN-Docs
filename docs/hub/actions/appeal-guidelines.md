# Ban and Warning Appeal Process Guidelines

We aim to maintain a healthy and respectful environment on our site and Discord server. Please take note of the following guidelines regarding bans and warnings:


#### One Appeal Only:

You are allowed one opportunity to appeal your ban. Make your appeal count by providing relevant and respectful information. our friends at Nexus Mods has an interesting example of how not to appeal

#### Categorized Bans and Warnings:

Check the  the ban and warning categories . Ensure you are looking in the correct section to find details about your situation.


#### Read and Understand the Rules:

It is crucial to thoroughly read and understand our community rules. Lack of awareness won't exempt you from consequences.


#### Username Recognition:

If you cannot find information about your ban or warning in a post, it might be due to your username. Double-check your username if you can't find it.


#### Alt Accounts Won't Help:

Creating alternate accounts will not aid in the unbanning process. We emphasize the importance of honesty and integrity.


To appeal your ban, follow the link to [appeal form](https://www.starlightcommunity.network/appeal). Provide detailed information and be patient during the review process and if it is approved the post will be updated to “unbanned”.


Thank you for your commitment to maintaining a positive community.
