## **Anti Harassment Changes**

Since the new site launch back in March, we used our forums as a way to display our ban records publicly for the sake of transparency, but when we initially started, we included Discord usernames and Discord IDs with the intent that you wouldn’t get caught in issues with them and stop with interactions with toxic people, but on August 15th, 2024, our staff inquired that that might not be a good idea because it might encourage [witch hunting](http://witch-hunt.urbanup.com/5177901). 

Now, you're maybe asking, why do you bring this up now? Well, our forums have been gone for a bit, but we’ve been looking into moving our public ban record to our new docs if we decide to just not bother with the forums, or maybe we keep them there as a backup if it goes down, so now instead of their username, it will display their Punishment ID (ex. CHH-420-ENB). It will be included with your formal notice, i.e., docs or the forums, or your ban reason given by Wick in your DMs. 

### Punishment ID Brake down

So WTF is a Punishment ID, and what do all the letters and numbers mean? 
Ok, let’s break it down:

* CHH -  The abbreviation of the server you were initially punished, in this case Certified Hood Hangout
* 420 - Case ID given by wick 
* (Optional) ENB - External Network Ban, INB for Internal Network Ban, or SNB for Staff Network Ban (as of this transparency report SNB has not been put in effect)

### Communication Issues

Another staff inquiry was the lack of communication; it not only affects CHH but SCN as a whole, with kicks, bans, and network bans just thrown around like its free money, leaving server staff, server owners, and even users confused, so I think it's time to follow CHH and do an internal rework because you deserve better; our community deserves better…
