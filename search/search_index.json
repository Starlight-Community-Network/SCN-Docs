So what do we mean by scaling down? We\u2019ll remove the forum and delete your accounts.

And then there\u2019s the last point. Make a whole new site and forum, and there\u2019s a massive problem with that: we don\u2019t know HTML. The reason we\u2019re paying so much is we made that site with a website builder, meaning we have to put up with the price they give us; we can\u2019t just export the site and host it ourselves. And if you're wondering, yes, we\u2019ve looked for open-source ones, and all of them were painstakingly unintuitive or cost too much.

The 2 CHH staff members heard that I helped design and make The old we used to have back then so me and 2 other staff member of SCN were brought in to a telegram group being pinged and constantly being pressured to take down the forum post making comment like \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d when asking them to stop and explaining I didn\u2019t make it because helping designed and making meant I was the one who made the post so it's my fault it existed even tho I had nothing to do with it, I didn\u2019t even vote for this member to be banned I left the telegram group from being overwhelmed<sup>2</sup> and KentuckyHawk followed suite because they were heated, and they wouldn\u2019t calm down<sup>1</sup> Clonn stayed back waiting out their anger, and they posted the unaltered screenshot the proving the banned member was in the clear. Fast-forward to Feb 2<sup>nd</sup>. This was kind of left on hold because it was a stressful event, but the co-founder of CHH wanted to quarantine the staff member that harassed me, but instead they went after both of them and flat-out revoked their staff roles till they figured out what would be a fitting punishment because it's been a few months. So we (SCN) or CHH couldn\u2019t hold any ground to terminate them; it has been too long to justify it anyway. The staff members found out they got their staff roles removed and thought they were terminated, which they were not, and nobody communicated that, go figure, so they proceeded to voice their frustrations, and the co-founder proceeded to tell them to \"de-escalate,\" and to be fair, one of them said, \"Shush, you, not to piss me off. I don't have time for y'all's bullshit today.\" which was a bit hostile, but telling someone to \"de-escalate\" when they're just ranting - I really can't blame them, and the co-founder kicked them after a while so the founder at the time the fonder and the 2 aggravated staff members got into a voice call the co-fonder joined and one of the staff members said \u201cshut up, I don\u2019t want to hear anything from you,\u201d and once again they were heated<sup>1</sup> and explained how the situation it was \u201csettled.\u201d but they missed the point they thought it was cause of a twitter post the staff member posted, and it was not they harassed an SCN staff member after being told to stop countless times, and they double down stating that I left said group because I was mad<sup>2</sup> not because I was overwhelmed. Then the co-founder proceeded to get hostile, stating that if that was someone else, they could have been the reason; they could be responsible for pushing someone to suicide and get in trouble for it (which, depending on the state, yeah, if they can prove that they wouldn\u2019t have committed suicide if the person didn\u2019t do what they did, but please look this up yourselves; we aren\u2019t a law firm). Fortunately, that didn\u2019t happen; I\u2019m alive and well. Let\u2019s put this to the side. Do you see a pattern? These 2 staff members often get aggravated, and leaving a group that took it as \u201cOh, they were mad\u201d? Didn\u2019t even consider that not everyone can handle being pressured like that, because telling someone to stop in argument is a fairly universal way to imply \u201cyou're overwhelming me\u201d But I guess they were never given that memo.</p>"},{"location":"hub/transparency-reports/incidents/2-22-25_3/#epilogue","title":"Epilogue","text":"<p>The staff members were given their roles back, and the original founder stepped down.
